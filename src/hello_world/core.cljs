;; Let us declare our state globally:
(defonce the-counter (atom 0))


;; This function, in reagent speak, can act as a COMPONENT.

;; Components have a very interesting property; they form a VIRTUAL DOM
;; and the React library maintains consistency between the virtual DOM
;; and the real DOM.  If the virtual dom is modified, the browser follows:
;; to wit:

#_
(swap! the-counter inc)


;; This is the basis of the reactive framework.
