;;; Integrating Reagent with core.async.


;; Let us declare our state globally:
(defonce the-counter (atom 0))

;; Now let us create a communication channel which our
;; UI can sent event to.

(defonce event-channel (chan 10))

(defn send-event! [e]
  (go (>! event-channel e)))

;; And imagine there is a global event handler
;; which knows how to route events around.
(declare dispatch-event!)

(defonce global-handler
  (go
    (while true
      (let [e (<! event-channel)]
        (dispatch-event! e)))))


;; Now let's write the dispatcher:
(defn dispatch-event! [e]
  (condp = (:type e)
    :increment   (swap! the-counter inc)
    (println "Don't know how to handle event: " e)))

(dispatch-event! {:type :foobar :value 99})


;; Now we can add an event handler with SEMANTIC meaning to our component:
(defn simple-button []
  [:div
   [:center
    [:h1 "Simple button example"]
    [:input {:type :button :class :button :value "Push me!"
             :on-click #(dispatch-event! {:type :increment})}]
    [:div#the-text @the-counter]]])


;; This is the basic idea behind RE-FRAME, which we'll see next time.

;;;; Mounting boilerplate below.

  (reagent/render-component [simple-button] el))

(defn get-app-element []

(defn mount-app-element []

(mount-app-element)
